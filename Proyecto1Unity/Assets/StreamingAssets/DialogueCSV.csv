1;1;Knits;Looks like someone needs some help... kikiki.
1;1;Bufo;That bloody greedy lizard. I don't even know where I am!
1;1;Knits;This is the jungle, shorty.
1;1;Bufo;What?! I have to get back to the swamp! Can't let that damn rat destroy it.
1;1;Knits;She goes by Lamander. I have some unfinished businesses with her... kikiki.
1;1;Bufo;That makes two of us.
1;1;Knits;Well then... ¿why don't you help me? That way we can both get our revenge on her. Although, I would have to test your skills first, kikiki.
1;1;Bufo;I don't give a damn of what you wanna do with me, I just want that stupid Lamander to give up the swamp.
1;1;Knits;Don't worry, you won't even notice. My humble abode won't be repaired by itself!
1;1;*;VC1
1;1;Knits;You see that path right ahead? Show me if you can go there and bring that wooden plank at the end. And while you're at it, bring some bananas along the way, I'm kinda hungry.
1;1;*;Reset
1;1;Bufo;You underestimate me, kikiki.
1;2;Knits;Just like I thought... kikiki.
1;2;Bufo;…
1;2;Knits;Well then, now I need 5 more planks. I thing they're scattered along the jungle. With them we can fix my home, say goodbye to this leafy place and travel all around the World until we find Lamander and beat her ass, kikki!
1;2;Bufo;I already told you I just want my swamp back.
1;2;Knits;Do you have a better plan?
1;2;Bufo;You already know I don't. Anyways, I'll see what I can do...
1;3;Knits;Well done Bufo!
1;3;Bufo;It really wasn't that hard at all.
1;3;Knits;I see I see. It seems like you would like moving around in a tightrope! Kikiki.
1;3;Bufo;...
1;3;Bufo;What should we do now?
1;3;Knits;You should go the mountain. A little bird told me that Mander, Inc. is onto some tricky stuff over there. Maybe you can figure something out when you get there.
1;3;Bufo;And what are you going to do?
1;3;Knits;I'll come along just in case you need a professional simmian dressmaker.
1;3;Bufo;Not enough with Mander Inc., now I have to deal with this tiring ape.
1;3;Knits;Said something?
1;3;Bufo;Erm... that I hope it isn't brassing monkeys over there! Anyways, I think we should get going.
1;4;Toucan;Tuki! So you're the froggy fella! Did you know that you can stick your tongue out by pressing the right button of your controller or left clicking on your mouse? You can lash onto enemies and activate mechanisms with it!
1;5;Toucan;Mander Inc. brought these signs. Apparently they act like lifeguards of some sort when you get near them, although you can only activate one-at-a-time. Try not tuki-fall often.
1;6;Toucan;These posh fellas from the city coming to invade us again... It's not like we have beaches or something...
1;7;Toucan;We are in this jungle just tryna chill man, and these fellas on Mander Inc. just tryna mess this place all up!
1;8;Toucan;Mander Inc. is coming? They better be ready to mess with me!
1;9;Knits;You are still missing some planks, shorty. You move around really well, but maths ain't your thing aye? Talk to me again when you have 'em all, kikiki.
1;10;Knits;Come on! Jump into the jungle! If you don't, I can't grade your skills, shorty.
1;11;Knits;Good intuition, Mr. Toad! Plus now you'll be as clean as ever for the job, kikiki.
1;12;Knits;Come on shorty! That plank ain't far!
1;13;Knits;Well, well well... your skills are quite impressive. Now I'll have to see with my very own eyes how well you climb up that tree.
1;14;Toucan;My waterfall is as beautiful as ever today! It's a pity someone is coming tuki-gross the view...
1;15;Toucan;I really hope they don't increase my tuki-rent...
2;1;Knits;Come on shorty, do your thingy! I'll be cheering you on from here.
2;1;Bufo;That lazy monkey...
2;2;Bufo;Hey, what happened over here? Things ain't looking quite right...
2;2;Dormount;...Were you speaking to me?
2;2;Bufo;Nope, talking to a wall.
2;2;Dormount;Oh. Sorry then.
2;2;Bufo;I was kidding. Do you see anyone else nearby perhaps??
2;2;Dormount;I guess you are right... What brought you here? If you are coming because of the race, it got cancelled. Sorry...
2;2;Bufo;What race?
2;2;Dormount;Usually by this time of the year we run a race down the mountain. Unfortunately, since Mander Inc. appeared here everything got suspended indefinitely.
2;2;Bufo;Wait a sec there, did you just mention Mander Inc.?
2;2;Dormount;Yeah. Why?
2;2;Bufo;Let say they also caused us some trouble. We came here searching for them.
2;2;Dormount;In that case, could you help us bring back the race? It is very important for me.
2;2;Bufo;I guess it'd bring me closer to Lamander. Fine, i'll help. Plus, I'm sure that if Knits heard me say no she'll kick my froggy butt. Where should I begin?
2;2;Dormount;First you should go find a tall bodyguard called K.O. Modo. He's the boss over here, his workers built the factory up the mountain.
2;2;*;VC1
2;2;Dormount;You should be able to go up there if you jump around the mountain. But beware, he is a very agressive and scary dude...
2;2;*;Reset
2;2;Bufo;It won't be easy getting up there with this bloody freeze... Welp, I'll see what I can do. 'See ya later alligator'.
2;2;Dormount;But I am a dormouse.
2;2;Bufo;It's an idiom... I'll talk to you if I figure something out.
2;3;Bufo;You must be K.O. Modo, right?
2;3;K.O. Modo;Who do you think you are, little toad?
2;3;Bufo;Your company is causing trouble everywhere it goes. The people of this mountain can't even run their race in peace.
2;3;K.O. Modo;You wanna fight or what!?
2;3;Bufo;No, no. Can't we solve this without throwing any punches?
2;3;K.O. Modo;Well ya know what they say. Everything has a cost…
2;3;Bufo;If I can do it…
2;3;K.O. Modo;I'm sure a little jumpy frog like you can do it.
2;3;Bufo;Pfft… I'm a toad. What's your price?
2;3;K.O. Modo;If you make the electricity on the company's stuff work and bring me 6 bankrolls to fund the race, your rat-friend can run everywhere he wants. I think it's more than a good enough deal.
2;3;Bufo;I hope you don't break your word.
2;3;K.O. Modo;Of course! I'm a trusty reptile.
2;3;Bufo;We'll see how this ends...
2;4;K.O. Modo;Don't forget to bring along your tiny friend. And beware not to bring him as sleepy as always.
2;4;Bufo;Barking lizards seldom bite.
2;4;K.O. Modo;You won't be that funny when I crush you.
2;5;Polar Bear;No! My house man! They fenced it!
2;6;Polar Bear;At this rate, even the bonfires will be taken by these Mander fellows...
2;7;Polar Bear;When I was young, all this was buried in snow… Now it's filled to the brim with trucks.
2;8;Polar Bear;This is a crazy good place to watch the race from! It's a pity that they won't let us do it this year...
2;9;Polar Bear;These mander fellows won't even respect nap time!
2;10;Knits;Kikiki. How chilly! I'll let you play with the snow on your own, I'll be watching your back from here.
2;11;Dormount;Watch out with K.O. Modo, he is very dangerous and will throw you downhill like a snowball if you piss him off...
2;12;Dormount;It seems the discussion went nicely without any trouble. I trust you on getting back the race, Bufo.
2;13;K.O. Modo;Ahem, I really think we negociated exactly 6 bankrolls. Hope you ain't coming back just to loaf around.
